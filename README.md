# DukeU
DukeU is a news app that makes it easier for Duke students to get Duke-related news and information. It's an ongoing conversation about the news, sort of like texting.

This app is my personal project that I work on for fun. As a current Duke student, I created this app because I find that it's hard to keep track of what's happening currently on campus since there are so many news sources like Duke Chronicle and various social media such as Twitter to get information from. This app offers a centralized platform where you can get news from all sources without you having to check each source one by one. I am inspired by the news app Quartz to create an interactive, texting-like user interface.

I really enjoy the process of making it and I hope you find this app helpful. If you have any suggestion to make or any bugs to report, I am happy to hear them and please send them to the email address listed on this page. 

Go Duke!
